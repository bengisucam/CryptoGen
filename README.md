Cryptology Algorithm

Symmetric block algorithm with 64 bit key which can pass Frequency & Kasiski Analysis. 

In this project :
*block the plain text in 256 bit form. 
specialize genetic algorithm to satisfy our needs.
*transpose the matrix in diagonal arrows by the key.
*loop the transposition 3 times
*XOR with the key in 64-bit form.
